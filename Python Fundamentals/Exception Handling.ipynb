    "# Exception Handling\n",
    "The most common reason of an error in a Python program is when a certain statement is not in accordance with the prescribed usage. Such an error is called a syntax error. The Python interpreter immediately reports it, usually along with the reason.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Exception\t| Description |\n",
    "| --- | --- |\n",
    "| AssertionError\t| Raised when the assert statement fails.\n",
    "| AttributeError\t| Raised on the attribute assignment or reference fails.\n",
    "| EOFError\t| Raised when the input() function hits the end-of-file condition.\n",
    "| FloatingPointError\t| Raised when a floating point operation fails.\n",
    "| GeneratorExit\t| Raised when a generator's close() method is called.\n",
    "| ImportError\t| Raised when the imported module is not found.\n",
    "| IndexError\t| Raised when the index of a sequence is out of range.\n",
    "| KeyError\t| Raised when a key is not found in a dictionary.\n",
    "| KeyboardInterrupt\t| Raised when the user hits the interrupt key (Ctrl+c or delete).\n",
    "| MemoryError\t| Raised when an operation runs out of memory.\n",
    "| NameError\t| Raised when a variable is not found in the local or global scope.\n",
    "| NotImplementedError\t| Raised by abstract methods.\n",
    "| OSError\t| Raised when a system operation causes a system-related error.\n",
    "| OverflowError\t| Raised when the result of an arithmetic operation is too large to be represented.\n",
    "| ReferenceError\t| Raised when a weak reference proxy is used to access a garbage collected referent.\n",
    "| RuntimeError\t| Raised when an error does not fall under any other category.\n",
    "| StopIteration\t| Raised by the next() function to indicate that there is no further item to be returned by the iterator.\n",
    "| SyntaxError\t| Raised by the parser when a syntax error is encountered.\n",
    "| IndentationError\t| Raised when there is an incorrect indentation.\n",
    "| TabError\t| Raised when the indentation consists of inconsistent tabs and spaces.\n",
    "| SystemError\t| Raised when the interpreter detects internal error.\n",
    "| SystemExit\t| Raised by the sys.exit() function.\n",
    "| TypeError\t| Raised when a function or operation is applied to an object of an incorrect type.\n",
    "| UnboundLocalError\t| Raised when a reference is made to a local variable in a function or method, but no value has been bound to that variable.\n",
    "| UnicodeError\t| Raised when a Unicode-related encoding or decoding error occurs.\n",
    "| UnicodeEncodeError\t| Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during encoding.\n",
    "| UnicodeDecodeError\t| Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during decoding.\n",
    "| UnicodeTranslateError\t| Raised when a Unicode-related error occurs during translation.\n",
    "| ValueError\t| Raised when a function gets an argument of correct type but improper value.\n",
    "| ZeroDivisionError\t| Raised when the second operand of a division or module operation is zero.\n",
