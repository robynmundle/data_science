    "# Bernoulli Distribution\n",
    "Only two possible outcomes, namely 1 (success) and 0 (failure), and a single trial. Random variable X can take value 1 with probability of success, p, or the value 0 with probability of failure, q or 1-p. The probability mass function is given by px(1-p)1-x  where x € (0, 1) or as:\n",

    "<img src='images/bernoulli_prob.png'>\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically expected value of any distribution is the mean of the distribution. The expected value of a random variable X from a Bernoulli distribution is found as follows:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    E(X) = 1*p + 0*(1-p) = p\n",
    "```\n",
    "The variance of a random variable from a bernoulli distribution is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    V(X) = E(X²) – [E(X)]² = p – p² = p(1-p)\n",
    "```\n",
    "There are many examples of Bernoulli distribution such as whether it’s going to rain tomorrow or not where rain denotes success and no rain denotes failure // winning (success) or losing (failure) the game.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Uniform Distribution\n",
    "When you roll a fair die, the outcomes are 1 to 6. The probabilities of getting these outcomes are equally likely and that is the basis of a uniform distribution. Unlike Bernoulli Distribution, all the n number of possible outcomes of a uniform distribution are equally likely.\n",
    "A variable X is said to be uniformly distributed if the density function is:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fx=1b-a          for-∞ <a ≤x ≤b < ∞\n",
    "```\n",
    "You can see that the shape of the Uniform distribution curve is rectangular, the reason why it’s called rectangular distribution. For a Uniform Distribution, a and b are the parameters.\n",
    "> Example: The number of bouquets sold daily at a flower shop is uniformly distributed with a maximum of 40 and a minimum of 10. Let’s try calculating the probability that the daily sales will fall between 15 and 30.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> The probability that daily sales will fall between 15 and 30 is (30-15)*(1/(40-10)) = 0.5\n",
    "> \n",
    "> Similarly, the probability that daily sales are greater than 20 is  = 0.667\n",
    "\n",
    "The mean and variance of X following a uniform distribution is:\n",
    "* Mean\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    E(X) = (a+b)/2\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Variance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    V(X) =  (b-a)²/12\n",
    "```\n",
    "The standard uniform density has parameters a = 0 and b = 1, so the PDF for standard uniform density is given by:\t\n",
    "```python \n",
    "    fx= {1,  0≤x≤1 0,  otherwise \n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binomial Distribution\n",
    "A distribution where only two outcomes are possible, such as success or failure, gain or loss, win or lose and where the probability of success and failure is same for all the trials. \n",
    "If probability of success = 0.2 then the probability of failure q = 1 – p = 0.8 (does not have to be equal)\n",
    "\n",
    "On the basis of the above explanation, the properties of a Binomial Distribution are:\n",
    "1. Each trial is independent.\n",
    "2. There are only two possible outcomes in a trial- either a success or a failure.\n",
    "3. A total number of n identical trials are conducted.\n",
    "4. The probability of success and failure is same for all trials. (Trials are identical.)\n",

    "Mean\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    µ = n*p\n",
    "```\n",

    "## Normal Distribution\n",
    "Normal distribution represents the behavior of most of the situations in the universe (That is why it’s called a “normal” distribution. I guess!). The large sum of (small) random variables often turns out to be normally distributed, contributing to its widespread application. Any distribution is known as Normal distribution if it has the following characteristics:\n",
    "1. The mean, median and mode of the distribution coincide.\n",
    "2. The curve of the distribution is bell-shaped and symmetrical about the line x=μ.\n",
    "3. The total area under the curve is 1.\n",
    "4. Exactly half of the values are to the left of the center and the other half to the right.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PDF of a random variable X following a normal distribution is given by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    fx= 12πe{-1 2 (x-μ)2}           for-∞<x<∞\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    E(X) = µ\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Var(X) = σ2\t\t\n",
    "```\n",
    "Here, `µ (mean)` and `σ (standard deviation)` are the parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "A standard normal distribution is defined as the distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1. For such a case, the PDF becomes:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fx= 12πe-x2/2           for-∞<x<∞\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Poisson Distribution\n",
    "Poisson Distribution is applicable in situations where events occur at random points of time and space wherein our interest lies only in the number of occurrences of the event.\n",
    "- Any successful event should not influence the outcome of another successful event.\n",
    "- The probability of success over a short interval must equal the probability of success over a longer interval.\n",
    "- The probability of success in an interval approaches zero as the interval becomes smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if any distribution validates the above assumptions then it is a Poisson distribution. Some notations used in Poisson distribution are:\n",
    "- λ is the rate at which an event occurs,\n",
    "- t is the length of a time interval,\n",
    "- And X is the number of events in that time interval.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, X is called a Poisson Random Variable and the probability distribution of X is called Poisson distribution. Let µ denote the mean number of events in an interval of length t. Then, µ = λ*t.\n",
    "\n",
    "The PMF of X following a Poisson distribution is given by:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    PX=x= e-uxx!         for x=0, 1, 2,...\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "```python\n",
    "E(X) = µ\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "Var(X) = µ\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Exponential Distribution\n",
    "Exponential distribution is widely used for survival analysis. From the expected life of a machine to the expected life of a human, exponential distribution successfully delivers the result.\n",
    "A random variable X is said to have an exponential distribution with PDF:\n",
    "fx= {e-λx, x≥0\n",
    "and parameter λ>0 which is also called the rate. For survival analysis, λ is called the failure rate of a device at any time t, given that it has survived up to t.\n",
    "Mean\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    E(X) = 1/λ\n",
    "```\n",
    "Variance\n",
    "```python\n",
    "    Var(X) = (1/λ)²\n",
    "```\n",
    "Also, the greater the rate, the faster the curve drops and the lower the rate, flatter the curve. "
