    "The name can be quite misleading since `JSON` is nowadays used not only in JavaScript. For example in data science, it has become a very popular way of storing our data. We can say that it is very similar to its predecessor, XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is like XML because: \n",
    "* Both are self-describing, meaning that the values are labeled, therefore 'human-readable' \n",
    "* Both are hierarchical (nested), i.e. they can have values within values. \n",
    "* Both can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages. \n",
    "* Both can be passed around using HTTP request (important for APIs).\n",
    "\n",
    "JSON is unlike XML because: \n",
    "* JSON has a tag name only at the beginning of an element (no tag at the end of an element), which results in a smaller size. \n",
    "* JSON is less verbose therefore quicker for humans to write and read. \n",
    "* JSON can include arrays, which leads to even smaller file sizes. \n",
    "* JSON can't use reserved words from JavaScript as tags.\n",
    "\n",
    "We now know the two most common data formats in the APIs: `XML` and `JSON`."
