    "# Relational Databases\n",
    "A database stores data in an organized way so that it can be searched and retrieved later. It should contain one or more tables. A table is much like a spreadsheet, in that it's made up of rows and columns. All rows have the same columns, and each column contains the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Relational database management systems (RDBMS) are software that let you create and use relational databases. There are several commercial and open source vendors to choose from. On the commercial side, Oracle Database, IBM DB2, and Microsoft SQL Server are three well known solutions. On the free and open source side, MySQL, SQLite, and PostgreSQL are three widely used solutions.\n",

    "## Entity-Relationship Diagrams\n",
    "To better understand how the tables in a relational database are interconnected, we can use an **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**. This kind of diagram displays each table as a box. It links these boxes together indicating what kind of relationship they have with each other, such as one-to-many or one-to-one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Watch the following video, which explains the key principles of how data is modeled using ERDs:\n",

    "# Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "Once you've downloaded and set up an RDBMS on your system, the next step is to create a database and tables inside of it in order to insert and manage your relational data. The way you do this is with Structured Query Language (SQL), which is the standard language for working with RDBMSs.\n",
