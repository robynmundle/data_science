    "The core concept of ADS is that we merge different data sources to have all possible information about objects of interest (the most often, these are our clients) in one place. We will then create a sliding window with all possible metrics.\n",
    "1. The core part of ADS is a sliding window for each time period, for example, 1 week.\n",
    "2. ADS contains one line for each observation every week\n",

    "\n",
    "As indicated in the picture above we use the same history to create each slice, for example 12 months.\n",

    "We can summarize the main advantages of ADS as\n",
    "* Combines all data sources into one table\n",
    "* In the future, ML models can be based on one table\n",
    "* By using time slices (weekly, monthly) we take care of fluctuations in the data\n",
    "* It suits as aggregation layer for the reporting\n",
    "* Batch scoring (weekly, monthly) is easy to implement\n",
    "* New data sources can be simply added in the future using joins\n",

    "### Best if worked in VSCode following the instructions descrived here:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are going to build ADS about our customers. We will store information about orders from the last month. We want, in the ADS, to have only ONE line per every customer and every month.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see how many orders we have:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "select count(*) from orders;\n",
    "select min(orderdate) from orders;\n",
    "select max(orderdate) from orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We can see 830 orders ranging from `1996-07-04` to `1998-05-06`. We are going to build ADS with values aggregated by month. We could use the same logic for a week or days but for training purposes, monthly aggregations are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, it depends on the industry that required granularity. For traditional banking, 1 month may be enough. For telecommunications, 1 week can be appropriate, but there are also industries like e-commerce where they need to aggregate per day.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our tutorial, we will aggregate orders from each month and label it with column called `end_obs_date` (end observation date). `end_obs_date` is the column that labels monthly slice we are aggregating to. If anything happens, for example in August 1996, we will assign `end_obs_date` 1st of September, 1996.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "* order date is 1996-12-12 --> endobsdate will be 1997-01-01\n",
    "* order date is 1997-01-31 --> endobsdate will be 1997-02-01\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, in our ADS, we will have following end observation dates: from `1996-08-01` to `1998-06-01`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We start with the create of table endobsdates. We will store all possible dates there.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE if exists end_obs_dates;\n",
    "CREATE TABLE end_obs_dates \n",
    "AS\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Recursive query example (something like FOR loop for SQL)\n",
    "WITH RECURSIVE\n",
    "  cnt(x) AS (\n",
    "     SELECT 0\n",
    "     UNION ALL\n",
    "     SELECT x+1 FROM cnt\n",
    "      LIMIT (SELECT ROUND(((julianday('1998-06-01') - julianday('1996-08-01'))/30) + 1)) -- this counts number of months between these two days\n",
    "  )\n",
    "SELECT date('1996-08-01', '+' || x || ' month') as end_obs_date FROM cnt;\n",
    "```\n",
    "    It's good practice to put drop table if exists before each table creation. This will eliminate errors when rerunning the script and doesn't do anything if the table doesn't exist yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we create ADS POPULATION HIST(each customer id for each month). We will use table customers for this.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DROP TABLE if exists ads_population_hist;\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE TABLE ads_population_hist \n",

    "CROSS JOIN (SELECT DISTINCT customerid FROM customers) AS B\n",
    ";\n",
    "```\n",
    "Let's see how our new table looks like:\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "select * from ads_population_hist limit 10;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, we have the main table where every customer has exactly one row for every month, even when they didn't buy anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our main goal is to create a table where we keep all the important information about our clients. In this tutorial, we will work with clients' orders and create following variables:\n",
    "* noofitems\n",
    "* noofdistinct_orders\n",
    "* total_price\n",
    "\n",
    "All of these information will be aggregated on monthly level. We can take this information from the table `Order Details`.\n",
    "\n",
    "As the first step, we will compute additional attribute `totalprice_for_product` as `unitprice * quantity` using the following select statement.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *,\n",
    "       unitprice*quantity AS totalprice_for_product\n",
    "FROM \"Order Details\" LIMIT 20\n",

    "           FROM \"Order Details\") AS A\n",
    "GROUP BY 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "We have aggregated information for every `orderid`. Now, we need to assign it to the correct customer and correct month. we will use table `orders` for that. We can see the sample of that table below.\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "    orderid,\n",
    "    customerid,\n",
    "    orderdate\n",
